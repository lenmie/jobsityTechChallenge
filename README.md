## Comments

- all of the mandatory feautures were done
- styled-system and emotion were used as main styling tools, both are quite new to me, but i wanted to take this opportunity to test them out regardless
- run out of time while thinking how to apply the favorite feature(was about to use react native context tool) and 
- a proper the test coverage was also left pending
